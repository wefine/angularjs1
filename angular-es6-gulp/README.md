# angular-es6-gulp
To use this sample project you need gulp installed (`npm install -g gulp`) .

The default task will execute `gulp serve` which build the sources, watch for changes
and serve them on port [4242](http://localhost:4242).

You will find several comments in the sources and build files and I wrote a
[blog post](https://www.timroes.de/2015/07/29/using-ecmascript-6-es6-with-angularjs-1-x/) on
how to use AngularJS 1 with ECMAScript 6.
